FmapLib -- An efficient implementation of the Functional Map Framework
===========================================================================

FmapLib is an efficient Matlab implementation of the Functional Map Framework, introduced initially in the seminal paper “Functional maps: a flexible representation
of maps between shapes” by M. Ovsjanikov, et al. in SIGGRAPH 2012.

The implementation follows the Object Oriented Programmin paradigm and it provides a big arsenal of object represantations. These include: Images, 3D Meshes, and Graphs along with Basis elements like those stemming from the graph Laplacian or the mesh's Laplace Beltrami operator.

This way, one can infer and manipulate Functional Maps, among all the modalities that have currently been expored in the literature in a consice and convenient way.
