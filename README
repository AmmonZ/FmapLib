FmapLib -- An efficient implementation of the Functional Map Framework
===========================================================================

FmapLib is an efficient Matlab implementation of the Functional Map Framework, introduced initially in the seminal paper “Functional maps: a flexible representation
of maps between shapes” by M. Ovsjanikov, et al. in SIGGRAPH 2012.

The implementation is strictly Object Oriented and it provides a big arsenal of object represantations. These include: Images, 3D Meshes, and Graphs along with Basis elements such as the Laplacian or the Laplace Beltrami operator.

This way, one can infer and manipulate functional maps, among all the modalities that have currently been expored in the literature.
