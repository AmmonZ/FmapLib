FmapLib -- An efficient implementation of the Functional Map Framework
======================================================================

FmapLib is an efficient Matlab implementation of the Functional Map Framework, which was introduced in the seminal paper "Functional Maps: a flexible representation of maps between shapes" by M. Ovsjanikov, et al. in SIGGRAPH 2012.

This implementation is Object Oriented and provides classes to abstract modalities such as: Images, 3D Meshes and Graphs.  This way, one can infer and manipulate Functional Maps, among all the modalities that have currently been explored in the literature in a straightforward way.
